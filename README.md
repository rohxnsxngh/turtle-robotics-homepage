# Texas A&M TURTLE Robotics Homepage Development

As the developer of the T.U.R.T.L.E Robotics Club website at Texas A&M University, I am proud to present a comprehensive resource for students interested in robotics and competition. The site was designed to introduce new members to the club and its mission of building robots and participating in competitions. Visitors can find information on past projects and events, as well as sign-up forms for prospective members. I have made sure to include all the important information for the new members about the club, its purpose, upcoming events and competitions. The website is not only informative but also easy to navigate. My goal was to create a website that is beneficial for both new and experienced members, and I believe that I have succeeded in doing so. This website has since been moved into a private Texas A&M University domain.
